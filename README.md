# ðŸš— WiFi-Controlled RC Car with ESP32

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates how to build an **ESP32-based WiFi-controlled RC car** that can be operated via a web interface. By hosting a local IP-based webpage, users can remotely control the car's movement in real-time.

## ðŸ”¥ Features
- ðŸ“¶ **WiFi-based Control** â€“ Operate from any device connected to the same network.
- ðŸŽ® **Web-Based Interface** â€“ Control via browser buttons.
- âš¡ **Speed Control** â€“ Adjust motor speed using a slider.
- ðŸ”„ **Multi-Directional Movement** â€“ Forward, backward, left, right.
- ðŸ”‹ **Separate Power Supply** â€“ ESP32 and L298N powered independently for better efficiency.

## ðŸ›  Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 WiFi Development Board
- L298N Motor Driver Module
- 4 DC Motors + Wheels - I used BO Motors
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires
- 2x 1800mAh Batteries
- Battery Holder & Switch
- Android Arduino WiFi Car App

## ðŸ”— Circuit Connections
### **ESP32 Pins:**
| ESP32 | Component |
|-------|-----------|
| D5    | L298N IN1 |
| D6    | L298N IN2 |
| D7    | L298N IN3 |
| D8    | L298N IN4 |
| VIN   | Power (5V) |
| GND   | Ground |

### **L298N Motor Driver:**
| L298N | Component |
|-------|-----------|
| OUT1  | Motor 1 |
| OUT2  | Motor 2 |
| OUT3  | Motor 3 |
| OUT4  | Motor 4 |
| 12V   | Battery Positive |
| GND   | Battery & ESP32 GND |

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. The **ESP32 connects to WiFi** and generates a local IP.
2. The **web interface** (hosted on ESP32) loads in the browser.
3. Users send commands via **web buttons** to control movement.
4. The ESP32 processes signals and drives **L298N motor controller**.
5. The car responds to user input and executes **directional movement**.

## ðŸ“¡ Web Interface
The car is controlled via a simple **HTML webpage** hosted by the ESP32. Open the **ESP32's IP in a browser**, and use buttons to navigate the car.

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions
1. Assemble the car **chassis, motors, and wheels**.
2. Connect motors to **L298N motor driver**.
3. Wire the **ESP32 to L298N** as per the connection table.
4. Upload the **Arduino code** to ESP32 (ensure WiFi credentials are correct).
5. Power the car and **open the IP address** in a browser.
6. Control the car using the **web buttons**!

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements
- ðŸ›£ **Obstacle Avoidance** using **Ultrasonic Sensors**.
- ðŸ“± **Mobile App** instead of web control.
- ðŸŽ¤ **Voice Commands** for hands-free operation.
- ðŸ”„ **Path Following** using **line-tracking sensors**.

## ðŸ’¡ Conclusion
This project combines **IoT, robotics, and web development** to create a **smart, remote-controlled car**. It provides hands-on experience with **ESP32, motor drivers, and WiFi-based automation**. ðŸš—ðŸ’¨ Happy coding!
